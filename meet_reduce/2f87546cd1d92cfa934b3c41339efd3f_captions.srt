uh for the conversation good we got the firmware  upgraded all right so uh i think we might as well  

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,200
start with uh i don't know if you guys caught  this but there's a red subreddit called um wall  

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,520
street bets and what they do on wall street bets  is they find angles and uh a thesis and then they  

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,160
bet on a stock the stock they picked uh for  the past couple of months has been gamestop  

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:14,000
and boy jason hold on a second um that's that's  that's not true so um do you uh i had actually a  

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,680
guy on my team put together two really important  documents and i'm just going to read them  

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,280
because it's full of so much interesting and  then we can talk about um where are these  

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,200
from did you say from the wall street bats no no  no i had a guy go in uh one of my team members  

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,360
one of my colleagues and go and summarize  the entire saga from the beginning and then  

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,680
we can talk about the the corporatist scumbags  that robin hood and other [ __ ] people over  

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,840
so let's let's do that in that way okay um this  is the way they call him the dictator let's uh

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
you're an idiot because you you just want to  defend people because you blindly stumbled into  

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,480
a [ __ ] trade that actually made a little money  lo and behold you actually invested in a company  

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,480
that literally they got on television yesterday  and they [ __ ] lied to americans right to their  

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,280
face this is a company that was insolvent because  now let's just put a pin in the following data  

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
point which i believe to be true i know more about  this than you do because i live in these markets  

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
okay so i understand what it means to be putting  on trades to being short to being gamma-squeezed  

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
to have longs to do all of this risk management  you're an early-stage investor so i know the  

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,880
intricacies of this stuff and what's happening  in here this company was insolvent they did  

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,120
not have the capital requirements to post the  margin that was being asked of them by their  

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,000
partners and so this was a platform level decision  to ban and block people from trading securities  

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,680
it cost individuals hundreds of millions  probably billions maybe even tens of billions  

36
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
and these [ __ ] should go to jail now let me  give you the timeline before we get into that  

37
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,880
june 2019 in june of 2019 a wall street  bets user named deep [ __ ] value  

38
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,720
began buying long dated january 21 calls what that  means is in june of 19 this person was betting  

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,760
that the stock would go up by january of 2021. he  spent 50 000 um which by the way today is worth  

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,680
about 25 million dollars by the way we should just  highlight that there are forums where individuals  

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,840
that are trading stocks talk to each other and  share tips and promote things to one another  

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
that's where this was taking place yeah and by  the way those forums exist uh in the professional  

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,000
organized world too amongst hedge funds you know  i've been invited to idea dinners where we all get  

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
together and we talk about the ideas that we have  and we're all expected to do fundamental analysis  

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
but some of those ideas are actually momentum  driven ideas and a lot of the biggest dislocations  

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400
in the market just as a setup here have been  because of momentum driven trading by organized  

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,520
capital okay so we've we've been stuck with this  for a while so so this guy deep [ __ ] value  

48
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
posts this and every month since he's posted a  screenshot of his position and he's titled it  

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:17,600
gme yolo update august 22nd of 2019 michael bury  who is this guy famous from uh the big short  

50
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
who's the guy that caught the mortgage thing he  discloses a three percent position in the company  

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:31,280
and he highlights that ninety percent nine zero  percent of gamestop's 5700 stores are free cash  

52
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,920
flow positive that's like pretty good he urges a  buyback and he notes that the company was trading  

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,960
at or near net cash levels so he's making a deep  value oriented fundamental thesis as well i think  

54
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
also it's worth saying what gamestop is because  even my wife asked me what the hell is gamestop  

55
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,720
last night gamestop is a retail store where  people buy video games i used to go to the  

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
mall all the time and consoles and headphones and  other stuff and they'll buy back your old games  

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
and so the stock got beat up over the last  couple of years as people stopped going to malls  

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
and stopped buying stuff in stores and everyone  thought the company was going to die and so these  

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
guys observe that maybe there's real value in this  company and it's making money digital downloads  

60
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
no one buys dvd roms anymore  or anything like that so  

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,560
and and the chewy founder who is  very successful at e-commerce came in

62
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,480
june 19 was the original post august 22nd of  19 michael bury comes in and says i'm long  

63
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,320
then a year later august 31st of 2020 ryan cohen  who's the founder of chewie takes an almost 10  

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,680
position in gamestop about two or three  weeks later on september 19th of last year  

65
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,720
a member of wall street bets writes a post on  gamestop and he notes that gamestop has a hundred  

66
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,920
and twenty percent short interest which i'll get  to in a second so hold on what what does that mean  

67
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,560
120 short interest and he defends the company as a  result of a few things he says number one there's  

68
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,600
a new console cycle coming just as jason mentioned  number two consoles are are not going all digital  

69
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,880
immediately gamestop loyalty programs have 55  million users they have a strong balance sheet  

70
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,240
ryan cohen just bought a stake and the shorts  were underwater and would be forced to cover  

71
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,600
if the stock ran up he predicted the convergence  of all these factors would lead to a big squeeze  

72
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,600
now november 16th of 2020 ryan cohen writes a  letter to the gamestop board and he urges the  

73
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,760
company to conduct a strategic review and share  a credible plan to capture market share in the  

74
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,720
gaming industry he said that they need to evolve  into a technology company that delights gamers  

75
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
and delivers exceptional digital experiences i'm  just quoting here not remain a video game retailer  

76
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,640
that over prioritizes its brick and mortar  footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem  

77
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,280
november of 2020 someone in wall street bets  highlights that a hedge fund called melvin capital  

78
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,080
was going long gamestop puts what does that mean  that they are synthetically shorting the stock  

79
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,280
by buying the right to sell it at a different  price in the future okay um and that they had  

80
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,960
been longed that position for more than four  years so all the way going back to 2016.  

81
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
fast forward to now 2021 of  this year january of 2021  

82
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,280
game stop strikes an agreement with ryan  cohen and adds him to the board of directors  

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,200
and gives two of his affiliates his former  ceo and and cfo of chewie also two board  

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,480
seats they collectively you know bring their  experience in e-commerce online marketing  

85
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,080
finance and strap planning the stock goes up 13  on that day and closes at about 20 bucks a share  

86
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,880
one day later and then over the next day after  that so for january 12th and 13th of 2021  

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
there's a ton of activity around  gamestop in wall street bets  

88
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,920
and now in discord and in stock twits claiming  that brian cohen is going to be the savior  

89
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,200
and then by january 14th so three days later  the stock closes at 40 bucks so now it's up  

90
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:26,800
125 so now comes the setup the pros versus  the joes from january 12th to today there has  

91
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,400
basically been a battle by institutional  investors on one side shorting gamestop  

92
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,800
and retail investors on the other buying the  stock and also buying the right to buy the  

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,240
stock or what's called call options and this is  what has created this crazy nonsense we've seen  

94
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,400
so on the institutional side after you know retail  drives the stock up the institutional guys are  

95
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,080
like hey wait a minute you know ryan cohen's an  idiot you know this company is [ __ ] [ __ ] these  

96
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,160
guys they have too many you know cyclical and  secular tailwinds and they become so massively  

97
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,080
short that the infrastructure that's supposed to  even count all the shares can't keep up and now  

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,520
they are short more than the actual number of  shares that actually exist so now they're 140  

99
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,480
short the joes retail they start to aggressively  purchase all these cobble options and on january  

100
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,680
13th and 14th um this price keeps ticking  up then a bunch of quant funds and momentum  

101
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,480
hedge funds notice all this activity and  they also participate on the long side  

102
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,880
and then over the past seven trading days we  have traded over 100 billion dollars of stock in  

103
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,160
gamestock which is well in excess of what retail  can support so here's what's crazy to realize  

104
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,960
a bunch of value-oriented non-computerized  non-quantitative hedge funds short retail notices  

105
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,680
of dislocation initially fundamentally but then  momentum-oriented buys other hedge funds realize  

106
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:09,200
also buy and this is what's created this massive  short squeeze on january 19th citroen research  

107
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,120
a research firm that basically tries to you know  find shorts in the market announces that they  

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,960
were short game stop and they gave five reasons  why it should go to 20 bucks the stock was at 35  

109
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:29,920
50 on january 19th then over the next two days  gamestop calls hit an all-time high and it runs  

110
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,440
a two-day rally of almost 70 percent and this is  what really starts what's called a gamma squeeze  

111
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,480
okay which is what we saw in the first part of  this week so january 25th ken griffin stevie  

112
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
cohen they inject almost three billion dollars  into melvin capital the firm that was short  

113
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,760
two billion from citadel and 750 from from stevie  cohen stevie cohen had a billion in it from before  

114
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,600
and then now all of a sudden the squeeze keeps  happening the squeeze keeps happening and then it  

115
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,480
starts to spill over to the rest of the market now  all these hedge funds these original hedge funds  

116
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
they are getting called by the bank saying hey  wait a minute you've run over your collateral  

117
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
limits you need to post more collateral  we need more money in your bank accounts  

118
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,520
so now not only do they have to cover gamestop  they have to cover all their other shorts so  

119
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,360
those go crazy and they have to sell their longs  so now they're selling you know facebook netflix  

120
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,760
alibaba so those things are going down that  accordion is what's been happening in the market  

121
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,240
in the last couple of days and then the coup de  gras is what happened on january 28th of 2021.  

122
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,440
brokerage firms and this is where jason we should  talk about this like robin hood and interactive  

123
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,720
brokers because in fairness it wasn't just robin  hood prevented their users from buying gamestop  

124
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,120
and a handful of other stocks they were only able  to sell which resulted in such a one-way pressure  

125
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,520
it caused a 44 sell-off yesterday  now that's been reversed today  

126
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
and so what it speaks to is a bunch of questions  there are questions as to whether or not this was  

127
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,640
mandated by the platforms or the regulators given  the fact that it didn't impact all the brokerage  

128
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:16,080
accounts it was a platform level decision so  some organizations like robinhood banned it  

129
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,560
some organizations did not and it could be  that some of these platforms that banned it  

130
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,200
is likely because and this is where  we get to the insolvency question  

131
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,640
didn't have enough margin and so they knew that if  they opened the doors there would be a run on the  

132
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,920
bank and there would be a run on robin hood and  that's why they basically i believe had to stop  

133
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,560
um allowing people to trade and it  just shows how um how fragile um  

134
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,200
the whole system is the last thing i'll say  and then we can talk about this is uh how  

135
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,760
does robinhood make money which i think is also  important to understand this robinhood makes money  

136
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,080
through a mechanism that's called payment  for order float so they don't make money from  

137
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:08,560
consumers right what they do is they watch and  monitor your orders they create a data file about  

138
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,960
that and they give it to these prime brokerage  prime brokerage institutions like citadel  

139
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,480
milliseconds before you do the trade what  that allows citadel to do is if they see a  

140
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,560
lot of people buying milliseconds before you  buy they can buy and that allows them to make  

141
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:35,360
money so to be clear citadel is responsible for 47  percent of all the payment for order flow volume  

142
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,400
they paid robinhood almost 60 million dollars in  the third quarter okay um plus another i think  

143
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,560
you know seven and a half million for s p 500  stocks and 31 million for non s p 500 stocks  

144
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,680
they paid them almost 100 million in the  quarter or a 400 million dollar run rate so  

145
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
if we had to summarize all of this in a nutshell  that's what we know we know that it started out as  

146
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:09,360
people debating the true fundamental value of  gamestop and it morphed into a momentum trade  

147
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,760
where a bunch of folks got dogmatic about a short  a bunch of folks got dogmatic about being long  

148
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,960
and belongs one and in the middle  what happened was a bunch of firms  

149
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,520
basically decided at some point to gate the  ability for people to transact in all of this  

150
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,200
which i think caused a lot of economic  disruption and that was because they didn't  

151
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,720
have the margin requirements and i think  it's because they were insolvent i.e robin

152
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,240
jason over to you okay um i think we probably  agree on a lot of things here uh thank you for  

153
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,840
the concise over we agree that wall street  vets and retail investors are incredibly  

154
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,120
powerful now and we agree that that's a good thing  we also probably agree that there are shenanigans  

155
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,680
going on with shorting of stocks i.e 120 or 130  percent short and we agree i think that some of  

156
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,560
these uh hedge funds do manipulate the markets  with these we also agree that it's unfortunate  

157
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,240
that uh in order to stay solvent robin hood  apparently if this is the information we don't  

158
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,400
have complete information right now so the thing  i do think that you're being tremendously unfair  

159
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,200
about and i'll try not to make it personal to mop  is that you've been uncouth and you're attacking  

160
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,920
people without with partial information i'll let  you respond to that in a minute and i think we  

161
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,680
agree that robin hood is responsible robin hood is  responsible for this revolution in retail trading  

162
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,400
they created the platform and they created the  innovation that got millennials to on mass embrace  

163
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,360
trading stocks how did they do it they figured  out a clever innovation of how to make it free  

164
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,080
and friction free they did that because they  did this selling of the data in the order flow  

165
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,640
okay we can debate whether that is fair or  not but facebook did the same thing they  

166
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,960
created a data business they provided amazing  products and services that you yourself built  

167
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,560
for five years and made a billion dollars off  of in order to make it free for consumers now  

168
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,160
there are unintended consequences of any  company at scale whether it's uber robin hood  

169
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,320
tesla etc and they will all have to weather  these storms and i think that there are pieces of  

170
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,400
information that you do not have chamoth and for  you to say that they're criminal and for you to  

171
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
say their scumbags and to act this way is i think  unprofessional does you a disservice and does your  

172
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
argument a disservice and you did this as  well with uber another one of my investments  

173
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
and that company weathered the storm and  they've done great things in the world  

174
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,400
and they and i'm very proud of that no no no no no  no no and i will be very proud of what i believe  

175
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,400
that and they brought in dara who cleaned  it up oh agreed agreed but they got there  

176
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,920
and so well what happens so why do you know that  i don't know well i i haven't talked to vlad i  

177
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,280
saw what he cares about vlad he lied on he lied on  television i don't believe he lied i liked it he  

178
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,760
lied on fox where did he know his life yesterday  what is the lie well jason he was confronted about  

179
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,760
whether there was a liquidity crisis and he  said to their face no that is not true i think  

180
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
this is being misinterpreted and  there'll be a clarification that occur  

181
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,000
i think because they were able to draw down  600 million and because they were able to  

182
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,160
take down a billion dollar investment from the  top investors in the world that they s resolved  

183
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,080
their liquidity problem nobody in history  has ever created this many retail investors  

184
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,920
than robin hood they are responsible for the  movement when they pitched me the company  

185
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,640
they wanted to create this revolution it is  paradoxical that they are now the enemies of  

186
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,320
the revolution because they actually created and  enabled this and i pre and they have been number  

187
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,840
one in the app store since this whole fiasco  nothing you're saying convinces me this is the  

188
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,520
they are the lehman brothers or bear stearns of  2008 to me they will not be they will get through  

189
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,400
this and there has this is an unprecedented  black swan event i think we would all agree  

190
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,840
nobody had exactly what lehman and bear said that  is exactly what they said and this and they will i  

191
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,400
believe robin hood will write it out because they  throttle the number of people coming to platform  

192
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,240
las vegas is not designed for everybody in  america to come to las vegas in the same weekend  

193
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,160
what's happened will you admit that that the tens  of millions of people that had their hard-earned  

194
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,720
money inside of robin hood was prevented from  participating in trades that could have been  

195
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,360
executed other places because of an arbitrary  decision by robin hood that they had it was an  

196
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,120
arbitrary thing to stay insolvent how is that  how is that jason an arbitrary decision do you  

197
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
think they wanted to make that decision jason  that's me telling you that they were insolvent  

198
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,200
that's not them saying it this is what i'm saying  right now communication was not perfect i'll agree  

199
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
the communication was not perfect they should have  just said we had no choice but to stop this or  

200
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,040
we would have been insolvent we cannot take this  many trades is that but is that what we call lies  

201
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,680
when people's money gets [ __ ] over just it's  inconvenient let me just say one thing i'm going  

202
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,560
to interject your your your vigorous debate um the  the important thing i think to note is robinhood  

203
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,160
makes money effectively as chamath pointed out  um through arbitrage of pricing in the markets  

204
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,720
and by providing leverage to their clients so the  clients can trade beyond their means i used to  

205
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,120
be an investor in a forex trading company  was the largest forex trading platform in  

206
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,120
the world for retail investors and 60 of those  accounts went bankrupt uh over time so there was  

207
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,360
a lifetime value on an account because the  uh the customer would come in they'd trade  

208
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,320
foreign exchange rates up and down they would  ultimately just get burnt up and that was it  

209
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,480
robin hood makes money when the market is  non-volatile when there isn't a lot of swings  

210
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,640
suddenly when there is a swing and that's how  they're able to provide their free pricing to  

211
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,960
people they're making a spread but suddenly when  there is a swing and the spreads start to widen  

212
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,800
they are actually exposed to losing money so  jason it's true what chamath is saying like they  

213
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,840
did face a liquidity crisis to some extent that's  why they had brought out they all agree but it was  

214
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,560
a function of their business model right their  business model provides great benefit and value  

215
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,520
in some extent during good times but when times  get bad it's like oh [ __ ] things are at risk  

216
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,880
and that's very similar to kind of the lehman and  and you know i don't disagree i don't disagree  

217
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,680
i i think this is an unprecedented situation with  the number of participants it reminds me of surge  

218
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,400
pricing with uber during snowstorms and that also  was an unintended thing that you know who knew  

219
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,880
that it would go up to 400 to take a ride and  that's something that companies will be faced  

220
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,280
with and they will have to then adjust and then  make it work and i think you know in the case of  

221
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,200
robin hood they should have just came up on  wednesday and said we can't take any more orders  

222
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,160
we can't take any more new customers we're pausing  signups you'll be on a waitlist because we will  

223
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,080
be insolvent if you guys make any more trades  and that would have i don't know if you believe  

224
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,040
that would have i agree with that so jason let me  just communication it's beyond poor communication  

225
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,640
people were blocked out of their accounts like  there was hundreds of mill incalculable amounts  

226
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,040
of economic loss that i don't know if that's gonna  wind up being true because all these trades are  

227
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,120
occurring now and the stock is rock is a rocket  ship who's to say that oh no i mean look i mean  

228
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,680
jason aren't the shorts all covered by now that's  what they've been saying on cnbc no there are  

229
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,840
still people how do you know how many people are  short right now and how many shares because it's  

230
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,080
the primes put the data together and they send  it to us do you have it handy because i've been  

231
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,440
looking for it online and they said ten times the  number of shares short have traded hands in the  

232
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,840
last ten days or five years i mean jason i don't  know i don't have it literally in front of me but  

233
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
i could get it in the next yeah just text one  of your people you've got all these researchers  

234
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,280
there um go ahead zach okay look i'm going to  try and thread the needle here um i think j-cal  

235
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,000
is right that um we shouldn't impugn people's  motives without having all the information and  

236
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,920
furthermore you know building these uh rapidly  scaling startups is really tough and it could  

237
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,880
have just been you know a function of you know  not knowing how to deal with unprecedented  

238
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,600
growing pains so i don't think i don't want to  be too judgmental can i just stop people hold on  

239
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,880
yeah nobody that's not right no but david  that's not can but you guys are not being  

240
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,440
accurate they have known for decade for years  sorry dears how this business work when somebody  

241
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,840
buys a call option they are legally  obligated when they send that order through  

242
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,360
they have to post margin on behalf of that person  so they saw this building this happened in march  

243
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,440
of 2020 they went through this liquidity crisis  they've had to draw credit lines before they saw  

244
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,680
it building in the system so this was nothing  except negligence yeah so so i was about to  

245
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,560
that i hadn't gotten to the part where i was  about to agree with you chamath i mean look  

246
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,480
all i'm saying is even if it was negligence i'm  not sure i would impugn all the motives to them  

247
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,160
that that's all i'm saying i'm trying to find some  common ground with j column that point but where  

248
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:19,040
i totally agree with yuchimoth is with respect to  the effects of their decision i mean the effects  

249
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,080
of that decision they made to stop trading and  specifically they didn't stop people from selling  

250
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,120
they only stopped people from buying so they shut  down one side of the trade and the effect of that  

251
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,320
was we had these hedge funds from wall street they  were on the ropes right i mean let's discuss who  

252
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,800
these guys are these are the apex predators of  wall street they are in the business of shorting  

253
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,360
companies to destroy them i mean that is their  business model and they are not academic traders  

254
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,800
okay who are just speculating on outcome they  engineer the outcome right look at their tactics  

255
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,080
just watch the show billions right they hire pr  people they hire private investigators they're  

256
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,800
participating on these message boards uh spreading  disinformation look at the the year of hell that  

257
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,240
elon went went through right they tried to destroy  like five years yeah yeah exactly they try to  

258
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,040
destroy uh companies to engineer that outcome  they create nothing they're in the business of  

259
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,760
of of destruction now the beautiful thing is you  had these reddit kids these pirates who published  

260
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,560
this manifesto right on reddit basically being the  heirs to occupy wall street they recognize look  

261
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,480
occupying like a like a physical space does  nothing to these guys we are going to hurt them  

262
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,640
where accounts in their pocketbook we are going to  get together and we're going to basically create  

263
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
a trade mob that's even bigger than their cartel  and they did they got 2.7 million people taking  

264
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,920
the other side of this trade and then when the  hedge funds doubled down they said [ __ ] you  

265
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,440
we're gonna double we're gonna triple down and  the guy on reddit said listen he uh paraphrasing  

266
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,320
john maynard kane said we can be [ __ ] longer  than you can be solvent and they were winning  

267
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,760
that was what they said right and they were  winning the trade okay and melvin was dead  

268
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,840
busted and citron was on his way to being dead  busted and they had to go to big papa stevie cohn  

269
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,720
okay and ken griffin to get to get their rebuys to  buy their revised to get back into the game okay  

270
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,840
and then they had these guys on the ropes they  had them felted okay and then what happens  

271
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,480
just at the moment where they're gonna like  basically bust them out of the game for good  

272
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,920
robin hood shuts down the buy side of the trade  and so what does that do it gives these hedge  

273
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,080
funds time to regroup to unspool the tray to  reposition and save themselves and to get out  

274
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,400
of the trade if they want to get out of the trade  you can never take that 24 hour time period back  

275
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,280
no matter what robin hood does now and so i agree  with jamaat this was like don't you this was  

276
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,840
tremendous david on that point i think it's i am  in agreement that the hedge funds deserve to get  

277
00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:00,160
their assets kicked 100 i also as i said we don't  have complete information of why um you know robin  

278
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,000
hood had to pause trading and the other platforms  and it was like five platforms by the way that  

279
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,160
had to stop or else they would be insolvent  because nothing like this has ever happened before  

280
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,200
this is a run that nobody's ever seen and now  we're back in the game and don't you think all  

281
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,560
this attention then drives more people to buy  gamestop which is what's happening today and  

282
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,200
that they're still going to get crushed because  they're still going to have to cover i mean  

283
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,240
look i i i don't like like i said look where i  agree with you is i think the consequences of  

284
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,600
this decision by robin hood were i mean they  were really bad right i mean we finally had  

285
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,360
these shorts on the ropes where they deserve  to be finally they're getting a taste of their  

286
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,480
own medicine yes and it was really bad to pull  the plug on on the though i wish they were they  

287
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,200
wish they didn't have to i'm sure okay exactly  and i don't know what went into that decision  

288
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
but here's the thing that i think kind of stinks  about it is the point that your mother is making  

289
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,840
about who is doing the the trade execution  for robin hood those trades are flowing to  

290
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,680
citadel well that's part who is that's part of it  but 40 47 but who is now on the short side of the  

291
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,760
trade citadel went in and bailed out melvin and  citron and so they're on both sides of this trade  

292
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,600
now how does that make sense well citadel yeah but  i mean what i would like to know specifically okay  

293
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:29,440
is did anybody from citadel reach out and touch  robin hood did anybody at citadel put in the  

294
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,880
fix and saying to robin hood of course that's a  good question we're gonna we're gonna cut you off  

295
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,320
you know unless you freeze out the buy side now  look 99 chance that didn't happen i don't know but  

296
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,960
that is a legitimate question we need to actually  can i just tell you the the question is important  

297
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,240
but the way that you phrase it is you call them  and you basically say listen uh you need to post  

298
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,600
500 million dollars of margin why oh well these  trades uh you know what we're going to arbitrarily  

299
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,000
change the margin requirements okay oh eight  you need to raise uh you need to post so then  

300
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,360
what they did was they pulled all the credit  lines okay they post margin trades are still  

301
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,200
happening like crazy right all these people are  buying gamestop calls they have to go because look  

302
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,200
when you buy a call when you as a user with david  friedberg quinoa buys a call robinhood becomes  

303
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,640
synthetically shorted right robinhood doesn't have  the share to sell you but it's giving it to you  

304
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,680
so they're technically short they got gotta go buy  it okay so this is what creates this dynamic where  

305
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:37,200
robinhood knew they knew every second of every  moment what was happening and more importantly  

306
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,520
what could happen at a minimum it's negligence  and at a maximum it's the fix well it was and it  

307
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,720
was it was fine to do it before the market started  to swing volatile right and and so when the market  

308
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,600
wasn't high volume and when it wasn't volatile  it didn't matter because they had appropriate  

309
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,920
levels of surplus capital or statutory capital  or whatever the definition is in this market  

310
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,720
uh to be able to cover the quote-unquote var or  the value at risk of their portfolio of their  

311
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,880
customers worst-case outcome but as soon as that  spiked as soon as the var spiked they had to go  

312
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,080
get more capital and so what do you do if you're  the manager of robinhood in that situation where  

313
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,120
your clients who've been making you a bunch of  money by trading stocks over the last couple of  

314
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,800
years suddenly they all get themselves in a bind  where the var on the portfolio is more than the  

315
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,200
cash robin hood has to clear assuming all these  people go bankrupt that's where robin hood had  

316
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,320
to scramble and so in that circumstance they drew  down debt and they had to go get a billion dollars  

317
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,720
of equity but if you guys were running that  business and i'm not speaking for robin hood's uh  

318
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
i'm not making the case for robin hood but what  would you guys have done in that circumstance  

319
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,480
you know suddenly all your and by the way i'm  saying they created the problem for themselves  

320
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,800
because they allowed people to trade on margin  with low bank with low account balances and  

321
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,920
volatile stocks prior to this it got away from  them and because you can't you cannot run a  

322
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,440
business like that and be selective and arbitrary  you can't say some stocks on certain days some  

323
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,800
stocks on other days some options over here some  puts over there that means you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]  

324
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,920
what do you do on tuesday or wednesday when all of  a sudden you're not tuesday wednesday this if you  

325
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,800
were a reasonable manager of a business like this  this conversation would have been happening at a  

326
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:27,200
board meeting quarters ago hold on a second let me  finish please okay it needs to happen quarters ago  

327
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,760
and in quarters ago what they would have said  is hey guys we've run some scenario analyses  

328
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,720
we've done some sensitivity analyses here's what  happens if all of these things can go against us  

329
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,200
that's a typical stress test that a bank has to  do right when you're a structurally important  

330
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,800
bank you have legislation that forces you to be  under these conditions where you have to make sure  

331
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,040
that that you can understand some of these  scenarios and then you have any any trading  

332
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,040
entity or insurance company they all have to have  that analysis of what's the worst case scenario  

333
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,160
and how do you plan for it and you have to you  and by the way coming out of 2008 we actually  

334
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,960
legislated that we needed to have these two and  three sigma you know event scenario planning and  

335
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,320
you needed to have proper credit so here's what  happened really number one it was under equitized  

336
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,440
right at a minimum the business was massively  relative to what they were letting their customers  

337
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,560
do exactly and that's really important because the  point is they let people trade with high margin  

338
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,000
and they let people trade in volatile  stocks and it was working until  

339
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,520
not just stocks but options which is what which  is what creates the real spin up the feedback  

340
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,920
loop that blows this whole thing up and and then  number two is they don't know what they're doing

341
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,960
i think one thing that's really  important i just want to say this  

342
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:46,960
we should stop pretending that trading in  stocks is investing in businesses and uh this  

343
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,680
is something we've said for a long time on wall  street but stocks shorting margin and derivatives  

344
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,640
those um those four things no longer look like  what the capital markets were originally set up  

345
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,360
for which was to help capitalize businesses and  allow people to exit their investment in helping  

346
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,160
to capitalize that business to another investor  that wants to come along it has effectively become  

347
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,280
a synthetic casino or a synthetic gambling model  that lets people trade things up and down and  

348
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,440
this has been the mainstay of wall street for the  last couple of decades and as you pointed out saks  

349
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,120
uh it really is a leech on the system because the  amount of money that trading firms and traders and  

350
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,440
hedge funds make doing this ultimately is taking  away from capital that could be invested in actual  

351
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,120
businesses that could drive job growth drive  economic prosperity drive innovation and um the  

352
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,520
volatility that i think we've seen is the ultimate  feedback loop that emerges from when you allow  

353
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,840
a casino to operate that sits under the guise of  being business capital and investing in businesses  

354
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,800
it's not i'll give you guys a statistic i  downloaded the data from cboe that analyzes  

355
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,280
how much volume was traded across all the  equity markets last year in the us stocks traded  

356
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,320
a total volume last year are you guys ready  for this 121 trillion dollars of notional  

357
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:20,640
um across 2.7 trillion trades do you think  that 121 trillion dollars of notional equity  

358
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,320
value trading provided capital to businesses  anywhere close to one percent of that total  

359
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,160
amount of trading volume it really is a synthetic  instrument that allows people to participate in  

360
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,760
i bet that something is going to go up and  i bet that something is going to go down  

361
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,160
with other people of an of a similar ilk and  one person makes money and one person loses  

362
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,160
money and at the end of the day the underlying  business entity doesn't benefit whatsoever  

363
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,640
and you see it when shorts go against  businesses like happened with elon and tesla  

364
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,600
and you see it when derivatives like cdos blow up  the [ __ ] housing market where people basically  

365
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,760
trade these derivatives that sit on top of  housing and that capital did not find its way  

366
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,000
into homes to help people buy homes it ultimately  led to the uh collapse of the only the only reason  

367
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,520
that lehman and bear stearns was shut down was  in 2007 and eight when they were in a liquidity  

368
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,360
crunch in the same thing and they basically  had all these trades blowing up against them  

369
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,120
and they couldn't collateralize them was that  the people on the other side were hedge funds  

370
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,720
and that's why you know they were put into the fed  and that's why we were able to basically like you  

371
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,760
know come out relatively unscathed and but i mean  by relatively unscathed is like a global calamity  

372
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,760
um the the tragedy of this is that this is  the tragedy of the commons it's like you  

373
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,560
know there is no organization of people that  can say hey listen i'm really rich and wealthy  

374
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,640
and what happened here was wrong even though it's  probably on the same scale and so everybody that  

375
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,200
was a participant in it is in in my opinion  i think is guilty of all of this they were  

376
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,040
they were complicit in the robbing of america  do you think calls and puts um and shorting  

377
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,320
should be allowed should those markets exist i  i do have a sense of common sense solutions and  

378
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,080
let me uh let me kind of give you them and then  you can tell me what you think so the first  

379
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
is we need to use modern technology let's  just start with that right to ensure that  

380
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,360
you know one share of stock right isn't loaned out  multiple times so that you can't have a scenario  

381
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,960
where you have more than a hundred percent no  brainer right that's a no-brainer so you still  

382
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
support shorting some up yeah let me let me  just go through the list and then you can tell  

383
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,560
me what you think if if high-frequency firms  can trade tens of millions of shares per day  

384
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,120
there's no reason why we can't reconcile who  the beneficial owner of every share is so  

385
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,160
maybe that's a you know now maybe we found the  first obvious use case for a blockchain right um  

386
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,920
like you can't borrow a share unless you can prove  beneficial ownership in a in a you know nanosecond  

387
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,440
which can only be done on a you know decentralized  ledger but the point is number one is we need to  

388
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,520
rebuild this infrastructure you can't have 136  percent of a company be short that makes no sense  

389
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,480
the second what we've learned is that again  the it's like are we going to basically have  

390
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,120
these blow ups every 10 years before we actually  address the elephant in the room which is leverage  

391
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,760
like you need to have leverage limits so for  example banks coming out of 08 have super strict  

392
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,520
oversight and leverage limits and because they're  dubbed systematically important we don't do that  

393
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,400
for hedge funds and i think we need to and i think  that we need to have the ability to realize that  

394
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,920
these these guys can cause systemic risk right so  um just on this example i don't know if you guys  

395
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,320
have ever heard about long-term capital management  yeah this guy john merryweather the asian  

396
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,120
currency crisis the whole thing collapsed so good  there's a good book on it well so it's it's funny  

397
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,440
but if you guys think this is the second financial  calamity it's not the first it's the third because  

398
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,040
the first one happened in 1998 so in 1998 it was a  firm call it was the whole uh economic system was  

399
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,520
going to collapse if the bailouts didn't happen  so listen to what these guys did long-term capital  

400
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,400
management borrowed they had 4.8 billion dollars  of capital that limited partners and investors  

401
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:14,480
gave them okay these [ __ ] crooks were able to  then borrow 125 billion dollars 125 billion on the  

402
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,480
4.8 billion of notional so they were able to lever  themselves up 26 times by the way synthetic margin  

403
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,920
right no actual capital was allocated to these uh  to this transaction uh set it was all synthetic  

404
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,320
like no no money moved accounts when no money  moved accounts so it was literally just writing  

405
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,680
stuff against debt that couldn't have existed yeah  so they so they built 60 000 trading positions  

406
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:46,640
and those individual positions represented  again 1.4 trillion right us dollars  

407
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:56,640
so you took these guys in a room took 4.8 billion  got knucklehead over here to give them 125 and  

408
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,280
then got these knuckleheads to sell them positions  and all of a sudden 4.8 billion equaled 1.4  

409
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,640
trillion and so then u.s u.s regulators  had to step in they had to orchestrate  

410
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,560
a bailout from a consortium of banks because  they were concerned that if ltcm collapsed the  

411
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,000
whole system would collapse because they didn't  understand so right so we have to we have to put  

412
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,480
leverage limits on top of hedge funds the third  is we need to improve disclosure the the rules  

413
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,160
at the sec right now is to discourage  disclosure that doesn't make any sense  

414
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,760
we should force everybody to publish what they own  on a weekly or monthly basis you have the ability  

415
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,800
to do it the technology is simple so you need to  imp improve disclosure because then watchdogs and  

416
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,120
other people can basically be looking at it all  day and identifying these risks faster not slower

417
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,840
the third is we need to do  something around open trading  

418
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,560
like why is it that you're you know people are  allowed to go to casinos why can you uh you know  

419
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,680
buy lottery tickets um but all of a sudden like  we're gonna decide who's financially literate  

420
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,360
a platform like robin hood can decide what's  bought and what's sold i don't think that's fair  

421
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,400
um and then the last thing is i think that  we should have a short-term trading tax  

422
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,000
um we tried to pass one in 2018 10 basis points  if you had passed this 10 basis point tax in 2018  

423
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,240
on short-term trading it would have created a  trillion dollars almost i did the math on this  

424
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,200
because i actually the reason i ran all the  equity numbers was to figure this number out  

425
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,400
so in the u.s we generated 160 billion dollars in  capital gains tax last year and if you look at the  

426
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,680
volume i described earlier in terms of notional  traded of equities and number of shares traded  

427
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,800
if you charged 0.1 every time someone sold a share  on the value of the share they sold it would equal  

428
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,960
the capital gains tax so what you could do is you  could charge 0.1 on every trade it would reduce  

429
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,720
all of this high frequency nonsense where people  trade in and out of stocks it would force people  

430
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,120
to trade for the longer term or basically invest  in companies and you could get rid of the capital  

431
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,960
gains tax think about that if we didn't have to  pay capital gains tax and we were only taxed when  

432
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,920
we traded out of a stock 0.1 percent you could  see an incredible amount of capital making its  

433
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,360
way into businesses and this would fuel economic  growth and jobs and prosperity um and so i think  

434
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,160
if you could pull that off put the two together a  0.1 percent sales tax on every share sold and get  

435
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,360
rid of capital gains tax the lobby is incredibly  powerful the lobbyists got to that bill but that  

436
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,280
10 basis point tax on high frequency trading it  just means like look if you're going to trade a  

437
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,920
whole bunch of [ __ ] every eight seconds you just  have to pay 10 basis points in and out 777 billion  

438
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,240
dollars of incremental revenue to the federal  government and it was lobbied out and i agree  

439
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,400
with you and by the way the more more money goes  in more money makes its way into companies right  

440
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,400
and that's the best you stop all the nonsense  where people are basically trading to bet that  

441
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
something will go up in the short term and you  get people to make investments in the business as  

442
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,000
opposed to the momentum lowering the capital gains  rate is genius because i think that if you if you  

443
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,520
are a retail investor and you can for every year  you hold if you can decrease your cap gains rate  

444
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,600
by 20 by the fifth year now all of a sudden retail  folks aren't necessarily gambling they're owning  

445
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,280
and their cap gains rate would be zero  after five years that would be amazing  

446
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,520
i i have a a basic question i'm interested in  your position saks and maybe even around the horn  

447
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,800
what happens to the if the short positions get  covered which they're going to be at some point  

448
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,560
in game stop i would think or some large amount  of when the short squeeze is off what happens to  

449
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,200
the people who are buying in you know to the meme  stock as a retail investor let's say over the next  

450
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
10 days are they going to be left holding the bags  is there any way this company could be worth 20  

451
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,640
billion or 25 billion because as freeberg points  out there people are not buying gamestop they're  

452
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,760
they're trying to destroy a hedge fund  uh who made a stupid manipulative bet  

453
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,480
great we all love the the robin hood story of that  not robin hood tm but the generic term robin hood  

454
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,240
um what happens to those people are they  gonna be the last people holding the bag  

455
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,880
probably this is not going to end well there's no  question about that i totally agree with you that  

456
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,880
people engaging in this kind of speculation and  buying at these prices it's not going to end well  

457
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,720
now i do think that the redditors actually had a  brilliant strategy right when they noticed that  

458
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,880
these hedge funds were over short overexposed and  they seized on that vulnerability they did to the  

459
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,200
hedge funds what the hedge funds usually do to  everybody else which is find the achilles heel  

460
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,120
right and pile in so i think the strategy started  brilliant now anyone who's piling into it i'd be  

461
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,760
real careful because i think the hedge funds have  regrouped you know and um you know the idea that  

462
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,520
you're gonna be beat them at their own game you  know when look i mean citadel is executing your  

463
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,640
trades i mean right that the trades are the  order flow is going from robin hood to citadel  

464
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,440
they're not going to be caught flat-footed they're  on the other side of this trade and so you know i  

465
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,840
just think the house always wins i'd be real  careful about getting into it at this point

466
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,800
robin hood just tweeted that now the list of uh  restricted names is now up to almost 35 or 40.  

467
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:24,800
i think it's worth um randomly picking companies  guys rlx what is rlx uh i think that's uh  

468
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,000
ralph lauren nope you're  not allowed to trade that um  

469
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,320
sndl i don't know what that is but you  can only buy 10 shares would a better  

470
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,840
solution chamoth be for them if they can't  handle this and they have the risk of ruin  

471
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,120
to just say we're not adding any more accounts  until we can digest all this and raise enough  

472
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,520
capital to float all this and do you think there's  a chance the sec is telling them you got to pump  

473
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:52,000
the brakes on this because we can't have a market  crash two questions jamal um i i think that the  

474
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,880
the the issue isn't um robin hood uh ability to  grow it's that they don't have their ability to  

475
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,960
run their business and so their incompetence is  gonna cause them to i think have to deal with  

476
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,200
if they had well if they had 20 billion dollars  in cash right now this would not be an issue right  

477
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,440
i think you're right okay so assuming they can  line that up because that's probably what's  

478
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,600
going on right now is a 10 billion dollar uh  investment is going to go into this company  

479
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,560
pre-ipo so that they can actually take advantage  of this situation and grow so despite the fact  

480
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,480
that you have an axa ground with them because you  have sofia competitor that's very far behind them  

481
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,400
that had its own colossal problems let's put  that aside for a second you're talking your  

482
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,840
own book without even mentioning it do you think  that if they had that 10 billion they would just  

483
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,800
open up all the doors or do you think maybe they  should say hey we're not going to add anybody else  

484
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,080
i think that what's going to happen is  they're going to get sued into oblivion  

485
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,080
i think that the class action lawsuits here when  people talk about the uh implied losses that that  

486
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,760
they that they had over the last 24 hours david  sachs is right you can't undo it the thing is like  

487
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,280
what in all of these other situations like in the  uber fiasco you know you can't claim much damage  

488
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,440
right because you can't measure it you could have  taken a bus you could have taken a taxi you know  

489
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,480
you could have taken a lift maybe you could have  walked who knows what it is but the point is that  

490
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,320
the the economic impacts um i think were much less  than maybe the psychological impact right like you  

491
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,280
were angry here it's the exact opposite which is  that you prevented people from transacting in an  

492
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,640
open market and when people signed up to use  the service that's what they thought they were  

493
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,680
signing up for and they thought that the risk on  the back end would be managed you have to remember  

494
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,280
it's not that the individuals did  anything wrong by buying or selling  

495
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,440
it's that robinhood did something wrong by not  being able to manage their business accurately  

496
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,280
and then that then impacted the users to  the tune of tens of billions of dollars  

497
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,920
that has to get adjudicated and so yeah  i think the right thing to do is to stop  

498
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,960
the business hit the pause button allow people  to elegantly transfer their money out do we have  

499
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,760
to remember on the back end of this whenever  that you have one of these market failures  

500
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,720
the clearing houses are allowed to instantaneously  close your account and transfer to another broker

501
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,800
instantaneously you have that right and so the  market does understand the systemic risk at some  

502
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,360
level they just didn't push it all the way through  to the end of retail and so we're going to have  

503
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,680
to unwind this and unscramble this egg because  it's a really it's a really big problem yeah  

504
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,160
you imagine growing growing willy-nilly because  everybody's infatuated with valuations and blah  

505
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,840
blah and you move into a regulated market where  you needed to understand capital constraints you  

506
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,280
needed to understand modeling you needed  to understand three and four sigma events  

507
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,760
it just means you're under prepared which means  at a minimum you can't be doing business until  

508
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,560
you get that [ __ ] under control yeah i i  actually think we're almost in sync on this um  

509
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,400
you have a little bit of an axe to grind because  of your other portfolio company i think that you  

510
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,880
still won't recognize that you have a way let's  talk about worse in the race wait because so far  

511
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,600
i just did they did they finish resolving all of  their harassment lawsuits is that all resolved now  

512
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,600
or is that still open yeah we've and then you  took them public so did did you work all that  

513
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,160
out before you took them public yeah jason we  we transitioned the ceo we've completely hired  

514
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,680
a new team um i mean it's incredible right  so you so your company that you took public  

515
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,840
can resolve issues and you can give them time and  then you can in fact become their mentor and you  

516
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,320
can become their savior to get them public and  save that company jason you should robin hood  

517
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,600
can't jump robin who can't can't talk about  his company that's going public right now so  

518
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,560
just as his lawyer i'm gonna step in and okay  no no make sure you don't go to him into saying  

519
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,960
something companies all of our companies and i  don't mean to create a lot of collateral damage  

520
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,440
here but sacks had a company that had challenges  chamata companies are challenged we've all had  

521
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,120
companies have challenges and i think focusing on  what is the role of an investor when your company  

522
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,240
faces challenges i think the role of the investor  should be and i take umbrage to you chama trying  

523
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,600
to dunk on me because i'm supporting an investment  i think it's a low blow and i take it personally  

524
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,080
i'll be totally honest i am trying to work with  the company to help them resolve the issues and  

525
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:12,160
i need to be loyal to my founders and i need to  say hey how do we resolve this how do we get here  

526
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,120
and work with them and you say that i'm right or  die but that's how i approach this is i should  

527
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,360
be trying to be helpful as a shareholder could you  i think you try to be too but could you make the  

528
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,200
argument that someone dunking on your company is  the equivalent of a hedge fund shorting a company  

529
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,640
i'm talking about my personal relationship with  chamoth which you know it's different than you  

530
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,440
know the the public markets right i know but what  i'm saying is like i think in the private markets  

531
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,800
we hear a lot about venture investors um you know  often speaking good about their own companies  

532
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,640
where people really get irritated is  when venture investors speak bad about  

533
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,800
other companies it's the equivalent of  the hedge fund short and uh you know

534
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,080
jacob i mean chamoth may be dunking on robin hood  i don't hear him dunking on you i mean i just said  

535
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:02,800
i stumbled into the investment at the opening well  you stumbled into vlad in a bar i mean you told me  

536
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,000
jason you told the story jason you told the story  recognized me in a bar and came up in pictures  

537
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,280
but you told the story flippantly on television  that you ran into man antonio's nut house what do  

538
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,400
you want us to think you didn't tell us hey listen  i had i had systematic scouts reach out based on  

539
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,880
traffic growth i sat down my that's not how i get  deal flow fine by doing a podcast decal if you  

540
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,280
want me to apologize for your flower it's through  this jason but jason if you want me to apologize  

541
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,840
for saying that you stumbled into it based on your  public description on television then i'm sorry  

542
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,520
yeah but it doesn't but it doesn't take  away from what we have i i think the  

543
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,080
investors responsibility this is what i think  is fundamentally wrong with silicon valley  

544
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,240
we are people that basically do this like hero  worship around founders and it's stupid i think  

545
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,440
we have a job as fiduciaries to the users and to  the employees and to everybody else that doesn't  

546
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,160
have a voice and most investors are incapable  of actually pushing people to do the right thing  

547
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,280
okay i'm pushing to do the right thing and i  always i've learned the hard way and in this  

548
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,840
example what i'm saying is this problem should  have been solved three and four quarters ago  

549
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,120
and that's a government yeah i mean look yeah  you said your mother you're right about that but  

550
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,680
i mean just to give jkl a little support here  i mean the reality is you know we've all been  

551
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,120
on the inside of these hyper growth companies and  you know like mistakes happen all the time because  

552
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,960
you're moving so fast and yes it should have  it should have been fixed you know but but you  

553
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,680
know stuff happens now the question is when bad  stuff happens is it an integrity issue or is it  

554
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,520
negligence or is it just people running too  fast and i don't think we know that this was an  

555
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,240
integrity problem i mean it could have just been  people running too fast but david that's what i  

556
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,200
mean you knew what the rules were meaning i don't  think i think it is an integrity issue the rules  

557
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,240
were not like all of a sudden in a crystal ball  and all there's a magic 8-ball that spits out a  

558
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,600
rule when you do a deal with dtcc when you did  a deal with your holding company for clearing  

559
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,320
you sign contracts those contracts should have  been modelable this is an excel problem this  

560
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,040
is not i i i i hear what you're saying and i'm  saying i don't completely know i want to get to  

561
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,760
the bottom of the relationship between citadel and  robin hood and i want to understand if there was  

562
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,720
any undue influence there okay or whether this was  just a case of hyper growth catching a company by  

563
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,520
surprise i'm not defending them i'm just saying i  don't know and therefore i think it's a little bit  

564
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,480
premature to be talking about giving this company  and i also don't think is there even a possibility  

565
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,360
that this has ever happened in the history of the  stock market or the modern stock market that's 10  

566
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,400
million new and well done i even say what it is  10 million new retail investors came into a stock  

567
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,240
you know where millions of them a day and that  the stock traded i don't think that we've ever  

568
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,280
had social media collide with finance like this  and it's very reminiscent of our discussions with  

569
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:59,360
democracy and journalism censorship and politics  we we're having weird behaviors because of  

570
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,720
virality and i think that seems to me this is  the most important learning from this experience  

571
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,480
forget about the fiduciary and the governance  responsibility of these companies whether they  

572
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,000
were good or bad will be resolved over the  next couple of weeks and months i'm sure  

573
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,480
as more information comes to light but what's  super interesting about what happened this week  

574
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,400
and i think is the most impactful societally  over time um is that we're seeing this phenomena  

575
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:30,160
where um individuals in aggregate can believe  something to be true and make it true and um  

576
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,080
we saw this with tesla and i i don't think tesla  got this level of notoriety because it was such a  

577
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:42,320
a longer play out cycle but elon you know was not  hitting numbers that people thought he was gonna  

578
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,160
hit margins production volume etc people were  shorting the stock but enough people believed in  

579
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,280
the story that elon told about what he wanted the  future to look like that they bought the stock and  

580
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,920
that gave him the ability to do shelf offerings  raise additional capital and ultimately build the  

581
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,880
business and make it manifest in reality that he  said would happen and the same is true of bitcoin  

582
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:10,480
and the same is true of trump and the same is  true of storming the capital in all of these cases  

583
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,400
there was a belief in something and there was an  aggregation of individuals using social media as  

584
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,320
a mechanism for sharing and talking and engaging  and creating a collective outcome that wouldn't  

585
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,880
have happened through a centralized system or a  centralized process and wouldn't have happened in  

586
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,000
the traditional way where history defines the  future and i think that is what's so powerful  

587
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,560
about what's happening right now and we're seeing  it in financial markets but we're also seeing it  

588
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,840
play out in politics and we're seeing it play  out in the real world um in a remarkable way  

589
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:48,160
and it goes back to this notion that like a stock  is worth the underlying value of the company and  

590
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,360
that that's not true people can dream a stock to  be anything as they did with tesla at the time  

591
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:59,440
that people were buying tesla stock the historical  performance of that business was not what hedge  

592
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,480
funds considered to be a you know a profitable  good business it shouldn't be worth anything  

593
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,040
but the belief in what it could be is what drove  the value of that stock and ultimately that value  

594
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,920
enabled that business to become true um and it's  just it's it's amazing to see it happening and i  

595
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,840
think the the counter which is really what makes  this so striking is the centralized institutions  

596
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,880
that are trying to block this from happening and  um the shutting down of parlor and the shutting  

597
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,120
down of robin hood trading are are equivalent  from my point of view um or at least equivalent  

598
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,840
i think will be perceived to be equivalent broadly  which is if a group of people get together and try  

599
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:41,200
and use an online service to make a change in the  world by sharing and talking with one another and  

600
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,240
communicating a belief a collective belief and  that gets yanked away from them the institution  

601
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,720
that has the ability to yank it away from them  is evil and it will force people to decentralize  

602
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,840
and it will enable new ways of trading new  ways of communicating um new ways of building  

603
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,280
um and and that's the profound change that i  think this decade is going to realize and we're  

604
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:06,400
just seeing it start now i agree that parlor  or wall street bets is parlor 2.0 right and  

605
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,520
and what happened as soon as wall street  bets started which is the the reddit kids  

606
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,720
they started threatening and they wounded these  powerful insiders these rich you know hedge fund  

607
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:23,200
magnates what happened they started getting  banned off of discord they got discord as  

608
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,160
a tech company to kick them off how did that  happen they've been talking on there for months  

609
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,480
and all of a sudden just magically right at  the critical moment where they're also not  

610
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,680
allowed to trade their free speech gets cut off  that's a that that was deliberate now i'll tell  

611
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,080
you how it happens is i guarantee you what  these hedge funds did is they went through  

612
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,800
the discord room and they screenshotted you know  any post that they could plausibly characterize  

613
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,320
as you know hate speech or what have you and you  know and and by the way i mean those there's a lot  

614
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,400
of raunchiness in these rooms but it's not  hate speech and it's not organized for the  

615
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,840
purpose of hate it's organized for the purpose  of trades but what they do is they weaponize  

616
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,560
these censorship rules and they go in and they  screenshot and then they give it to discord and  

617
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,640
they get these guys kicked off and this is exactly  what i've been talking about with censorship it  

618
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,320
starts with something you like and then becomes  something you don't how many of the people  

619
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,280
who support these you know reddit kids were in  favor of de-platforming trump and parlor and now  

620
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,360
they can see where it goes this is slippery  slope and we've only had to wait three weeks  

621
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:33,040
to see where it goes it goes to the same place  which is when the people in power get threatened  

622
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,760
they use these rules they weaponize these rules  to shut down the outsiders and the upstarts  

623
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,480
that is the problem with censorship that is why  you cannot let the beast get started i completely  

624
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,920
agree and i think this is exactly why how i  think where we came out was you know the deep  

625
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:55,040
platforming of trump made no sense i think the the  economic censorship of robin hood makes no sense  

626
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,840
yeah and you can argue it's the right thing to  do with a narrow context but when you take the  

627
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,320
broader point of view of the implications that's  where this becomes really shaky and really scary  

628
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,440
and i think really enables a decentralized  movement that is going to be a lot broader  

629
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,120
um than than folks are really realizing at this  point you know folks don't want to be trading um  

630
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,200
on a system that tells them how to trade and folks  don't want to be communicating on a system that  

631
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:27,040
tells them how to communicate if i gave if i was  running robin hood and i said uh we're going to  

632
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,720
have two options there's going to be a robin hood  diamond membership and you pay by the trade and  

633
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,920
you know you get these special features and then  the robin hood free you know you you get uh your  

634
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,120
data is sold or however it works would that  be a possible solution i think to the optics  

635
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,080
issue here where consumers could basically pick  just like if facebook or instagram woke up one  

636
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,200
day and said for 9.95 a month you can have none  of your data no advertising ad free like hulu  

637
00:58:54,080 --> 00:59:00,240
hula premium i would so here's the thing j cal um  i i hope your robin hood investment is successful  

638
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,200
i just think that there are now three moments in  robin hood's life there is pre this week and it  

639
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,240
is what it is it's an 11 billion unicorn  god bless them then there was this week  

640
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,440
where we have to frankly hold people accountable  for the economic damage that they created this  

641
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,320
week because it is measurable okay it's not  that it's not like missing it you know um  

642
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,880
uh it's it's not like you know surge pricing  in uber it's not you know uh facebook growing  

643
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,200
too fast and allowing you know pictures of breasts  getting posted and i'll have to catch up it's not  

644
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,040
that okay it's not a bunch of like disinformation  that we can't really judge this is very discreetly  

645
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,840
judgeable and so in this week robin hood existed  as a different company and i think that there's an  

646
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,160
implication for that then to your point honestly  i agree with you it's what happens from here and  

647
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,280
i and they should survive but they have to learn  and i think what they have to learn is you have  

648
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,480
to stop the account growth you have to massively  shore up the balance sheet take the dilution get  

649
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,200
the capital you need because let's be honest i'm  sorry but nobody's gonna show up with five or ten  

650
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,680
billion dollars at 11 billion pre they'll show up  at five or ten billion dollars at three billion  

651
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,480
pre and they should take the money and then they  should allow the platform to work as intended or  

652
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,120
at least as perceived to be intended to their  users and then they should reopen to everybody  

653
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,000
what would you do david if you were in charge and  then let's move on to our next topic well i i mean  

654
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,080
i i i i feel like we probably talked about robin  hood enough and i kind of want to go back to the  

655
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,640
point that that freeberg was making just kind of  up leveling this a minute which is i i definitely  

656
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:38,960
think this is part of this ongoing populism versus  the elite war and social media is now the tool  

657
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,160
that the people use to organize themselves against  these powerful elites it's why we cannot allow  

658
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:53,120
censorship because it always comes down uh it to  benefit the powerful the elites against the people  

659
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,120
trying to organize against them that was for to  me one of the biggest takeaways from this week  

660
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,480
and and look the reason why people are organizing  is they're asking the question what is the  

661
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:09,040
societal benefit of these big hedge funds in  relation to the enormous sums of money they make  

662
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,640
every year you go to like the forbes rich list or  whatever and every year these guys are taking down  

663
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,280
the most money they're not creating companies you  know and chamath is right we can't have founder  

664
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,960
worship because they make mistakes too but at  least founders are creating things right they're  

665
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:29,920
taking big risks that they're not providing risk  capital like what we do okay we're investors but  

666
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,440
we're funding people's you know we're we're taking  the risk of writing checks to to start the guy  

667
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,440
who's got nothing right or gal yep you know they  them it's all all good all of them all of them  

668
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:49,760
so so but try to keep you from getting canceled  here but but but but what it what exactly is the  

669
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,160
societal value of these hedge funds now i know  that they provide some price discovery and they  

670
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,760
provide greater liquidity to markets but is that  really worth them really being the richest players  

671
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,000
in the game it doesn't make any sense and then  when they lose like in 2008 they get bailed out  

672
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,320
it makes sense it makes no sense something  is wrong here now is this a right-wing view  

673
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:15,120
a left-wing view it feels to me like there's a  political realignment happening here where the  

674
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,880
left and the right we're all getting on board with  this idea and it's got to get fixed yeah this this  

675
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,200
might be the legacy of trumpet way sacks that he  created so much disruption over those four years  

676
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,520
that now we're actually finding out where the  actual breaking points are in society and this  

677
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,200
is one of them and the healthcare system is one  of them and freedom of speech is one of them and  

678
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,520
we need to address each of these and they're  complex but there is common ground i mean when  

679
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:45,760
aoc and ted cruz are both agreeing uh on the  same issue with something's going on here like  

680
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,120
i think we have to fight the real enemy chamath  and i should not be fighting over this because  

681
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,280
i can tell you if chamoth did the series a and  this he would be backing up robin hood like this  

682
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,640
to the end of the end of earth and that's  totally fine and i agree with jason i just  

683
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,400
i just want you to know number one i love you  with all my heart and i and i hope you make it  

684
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,560
i hope you i hope you make dinner hundreds  and hundreds of millions of dollars but  

685
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,640
there's a it's just like you know you were you  just got upset with me because you thought i was  

686
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,280
kind of saying that you stumbled into it i didn't  mean it that way i was just repeating the way that  

687
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,480
i heard the story but something that touches  me equally ferociously is this idea of like the  

688
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,960
little guy getting run over by some like you know  objective thing over here that makes a decision  

689
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,720
that's arbitrary i'm 100 agreement with you and so  like the idea that like you know somebody who's on  

690
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,200
an app all of a sudden gets censored somebody that  you know makes a post gets cancelled somebody that  

691
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:45,600
all tries to make a trade can't it feels unfair  it feels that each individual is suffering some  

692
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:52,720
pretty deep inequity yes and i can't i just can't  stand that it really just touches me in a way  

693
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,920
that tilts me and i get very and you know what  it's interesting i think the reason i made the  

694
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,280
robin hood investment is because my belief in the  underdog in my belief in people's ability to come  

695
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,640
up from being poor middle class to middle class  or affluent freedberg you haven't chimed in yet  

696
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,840
as we wrap here and then move on to our  second topic i think we're at an hour  

697
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:20,800
so it's um so i just want to say um you know we  talked about decentralization and you know we  

698
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,440
all feel the emotional response to the little guy  getting screwed by the big guy that controls the  

699
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:32,800
system and we want to fight the system that's  the basis of every great movie um it's worth  

700
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,560
highlighting though that decentralization and what  i would kind of characterize as swarming behavior  

701
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:44,160
uncontrolled swarming behavior can actually have  negative consequences and there's a reason systems  

702
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,280
exist you know um when you put a bunch of people  in a room let's say you put 100 people in a room  

703
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,800
and every time and someone says the word door and  every time you hear the word door you're supposed  

704
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,760
to repeat it within 30 seconds the entire  room will be like deafening with everyone's  

705
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,560
screaming door door and suddenly everyone will be  screaming it that's a feedback loop that occurs  

706
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,600
in an uncontrolled social system and that's what's  occurred with gamestop and it's what occurred with  

707
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:13,680
with bitcoin so there are as we've seen remarkable  outcomes when you allow systems to operate without  

708
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,880
centralized control and without centralized brake  pads that that kind of slow them down or put in  

709
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,480
place some rules and some obligations to how that  system operates the problem with decentralization  

710
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,640
and this swarming approach uh to to resolution  where lots of people basically work together  

711
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,720
individually is you end up with things like  cancel culture where um before a judge and jury  

712
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,280
determines whether or not someone did something  wrong the community decides that person should be  

713
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,080
punished and shuts them down in the real world and  their career and their life is ended and ruined  

714
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,880
and we saw the same and we saw the same with  the capital riots you know people basically died  

715
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,760
because of the swarm that occurred where this  idea that the there was fraud in the election  

716
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:05,120
became an echoing deafening noise for these people  and they swarmed and killed people and the system  

717
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:09,760
by which you can actually have vigorous debate and  the system by which you can actually have controls  

718
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,320
and processes and judges and juries and trials  is what needs to be improved for this to work  

719
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:21,360
otherwise people will go to decentralization and  you will have a lord of the flies moment that  

720
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:29,040
engulfs civil society because the tools are there  today and so centralized systems can work but they  

721
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:35,440
have to adapt and adapt quickly to be fair and to  enable and to not um discriminate otherwise we're  

722
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,600
gonna see lord of the flies and we're gonna see  decentralization being the solution to getting  

723
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,680
out of the system that's inhibiting us and we're  gonna end up having really [ __ ] ugly outcomes  

724
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,080
there's a psychological term for what you're  describing it's the diffusion of responsibility  

725
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,320
when and also known as mob behavior when a  group of people collectively do something  

726
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:59,440
their individual morality can evaporate and the  larger the group and the uh more intense the  

727
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,400
behavior the less responsibility each person takes  for it so five people on the steps of the capital  

728
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,640
you know one person breaks a window maybe somebody  breaks it but once you have 500 or 5 000 and one  

729
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,880
person breaks a window now you got a much higher  percentage of people start breaking windows and  

730
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,520
that's when tragedies happen of course world war  ii was the diffusion of responsibility with the  

731
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,640
team yeah you're totally right yeah you're totally  here just just one quick point then we can just  

732
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,040
move on yeah so i think these like viral tools  these social networks they enable two things they  

733
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:32,880
enable mobs but they also enable movements i think  the mobs are bad and the movements are good or  

734
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,480
they can be good depending on what their manifesto  and what their mission is and so i think we want  

735
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,720
to enable the movements but we want to be really  careful about the mobs and you know one of the  

736
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,840
things that's kind of disturbing about twitter is  i generally find that like the tweets that seem  

737
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,920
to go the most viral are the ones that are full  of rage and anger and the ones that are trying  

738
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,160
to make more nuance points just kind of get lost  and so there is something a little bit disturbing  

739
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,960
about the mob behavior but but the movement the  enabling of these new movements i think is really  

740
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,040
powerful and that's what wall street bets was  at least in the early stage and they did not  

741
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:10,400
deserve to get shut down like that social social  networks are a collective amygdala they are not a  

742
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,440
collective cerebral cortex and i think if someone  can solve that problem and get people to think  

743
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,800
about the rational objective outcomes in a social  way in its engaging a fashion as it is to kind of  

744
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:26,000
be excited by the negative shift that excites the  amygdala um you know it could be really powerful  

745
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,040
but that's probably we're gonna need politicians  who we're gonna need some level of politician who  

746
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,840
has some integrity and some expertise if  only well don't you think don't you think

747
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,240
don't you guys think that what this means  is that uh entrepreneurs now can really  

748
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,880
think about decentralization as the key feature  like in many of these markets or these systems  

749
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,160
where we have the centralized authority we  have to move to a much more decentralized  

750
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,080
democratized way of doing things whether it's  stock trading or whether it's healthcare records  

751
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,160
or whether it's you know education  systems and degrees and accreditation  

752
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,240
there has to be a way where you can't morally  yeah but with morally and ethically inclined and  

753
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:16,880
or legally inclined systems that ensure that the  behavior of that system doesn't run amok and you  

754
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:23,680
know that's really where things can um can go can  go awry uh as we've seen lately um but it's a hard  

755
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,960
problem to solve it i i don't think we're gonna  solve it here today just uh a final update fif  

756
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,440
i don't know if this is exactly correct but i just  asked on twitter how many shares of gamestop we're  

757
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:39,680
still short apparently they're still 55 billion  shares are so short uh of the 70 million or so  

758
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:46,480
total shares and 47 million in the float um so  something very bad could still happen here i  

759
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,280
mean these shorts have not been covered so  this is going to be an ongoing saga where  

760
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,560
i think every single platform if if consumers keep  buying these shares what is the end does anybody  

761
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,960
have an idea or a prediction on the end game  here and then we'll move on what is the end game  

762
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,520
if another five million people buy the shares or  10 million people buy it it goes to a thousand or  

763
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:11,200
two thousand what happens if gamestop is worth  a hundred billion dollars it's such a great  

764
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:16,560
thing that's a great question well can i tell you  jason what that means there's a great article in  

765
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,800
the information which sam lesson wrote i don't  know if you guys read it but it basically said  

766
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,840
why did tesla win now this is not accurate but i  think his framing is relatively accurate which is  

767
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,240
people were buying elon like they  would buy a trading card that's right  

768
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:37,920
and and tesla is a manifestation of elon that's  right um and it actually is so visually it makes  

769
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,240
a ton of sense to me like then i think you know  why have like richard branson's businesses worked  

770
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:48,960
or why is the jordan brand work or all the you  know at a smaller level yeah at a smaller level  

771
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,280
because we're brands and we have these values  and people can imbue their their collective  

772
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,960
decision making and support to the person versus  the institution it's a belief it's a belief in  

773
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,080
what that person represents too you know i can uh  why did uh uh mbs buy that freaking painting that  

774
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,400
wasn't even a leonardo painting for a billion  dollars you know there was some belief there  

775
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,200
you know is it really worth a billion dollars it  doesn't matter at the end of the day most assets  

776
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:21,520
are most assets are purchased under the premise  that i believe the price will be higher tomorrow  

777
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,440
than it is today and if we all believe that then  we will all buy it today and we will all find more  

778
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,080
people buying it tomorrow that's what bitcoin is  do we all agree though that gamestop is not tesla  

779
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,840
i don't agree with your premise i don't think  that stocks necessarily need to be reflective of  

780
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,240
the underlying business and that's what so but but  no just think about it that's what's so shocking  

781
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:47,280
about this week because we've all been taught in  these freaking economics books and these financial  

782
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:52,400
analysis books oh the stock is worth x dollars  this kind of cash flow what company has ever paid  

783
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:58,320
out dividends that equal the amount that you paid  to buy the freaking stock unless you lived in 1926  

784
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,440
it hasn't happened so everything we've been taught  about dcfs and future cash flows and everything  

785
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,560
is nonsense at the end of the day every stock  trades based on the assumption that someone  

786
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,440
will pay more for it than i am paying for it  today that is it that is entirely what a stock  

787
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,080
is and so if everyone's belief is completely  uncoupled from the underlying asset that that  

788
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,880
stock is meant to represent it doesn't freaking  matter and it highlights what's really going on  

789
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,600
trading stocks is not investing in businesses and  can i say yeah can i say something else on top of  

790
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,280
this jason what was the name of the remember when  we were talking about censorship what was the name  

791
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,680
of the the the left podcast that got canceled  on twitter right side uh red scare red scare  

792
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,320
is gamestop red scare or at the real donald trump  

793
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,040
and my point is who the hell are we to  decide right how does it affect you all

794
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,040
what's your prediction we're sitting  here a year from now full year out  

795
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,640
what does gamestop january 2022 look like  what does the stock price look like what is  

796
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,360
the business look like what how does this all  resolve itself you know i'm i'm not a public  

797
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,640
stock market trader i'm just not i i just feel  like it's i'm not a day trader i don't i don't  

798
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:16,080
buy public stocks it's just kind of like to me  it's a distraction what do you buy this end i  

799
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,520
you know just buy vanguard funds like guys if  you're listening to this program and you're  

800
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,800
wondering where to put your money just buy  vanguard funds and stop worrying about it  

801
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,680
index low fees index yeah low fee index yeah  i mean if you want to bet specific companies  

802
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:34,080
because you get enjoyment out of it do it but  yeah okay so nobody has any idea what happens if  

803
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,280
it hits 100 billion or how this ends so i think  that's that's illustrative of my point is that  

804
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:45,600
for somewhat intelligent people who have some  degree of expertise in this area we have no idea  

805
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,120
how this ends but this is the box no but this  is the point it is a it is a collective ouija  

806
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,440
board moment everyone's got their hand on the  ouija board and they're gonna craft the sentence  

807
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,840
any one of us individually cannot predict what  a collective group of three million plus people  

808
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,920
are going to do and we've you know we we try and  struggle and think about the underlying value of  

809
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,920
a business which is what these hedge funds have  done historically but at the end of the day this  

810
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,840
thing is going to be worth what the market tells  you it's worth and what the market chooses to do  

811
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:17,920
we wouldn't know because we are not the collective  three million um jason yeah yeah let me respect so  

812
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,000
so look jason there's two questions right there's  always this question of like what should the price  

813
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,160
be and then who gets to decide and look do i  personally think gamestop is overvalued yes  

814
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,040
of course i think it's going to end very badly but  the question is who gets to decide and is the game  

815
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,480
going to be rigged by powerful insiders against  outsiders just it's just like the same question  

816
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,760
with parlor okay which is who gets it's not about  which look we can say that there are certain views  

817
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:49,760
that are bad okay but the question is who gets the  power to decide that and it's and and that's what  

818
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,640
that's the thing we have to ask is that second  order question of who has the power to decide is  

819
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:00,480
there any outcome amazon got to decide and robin  hood got to decide and the victims were parlor and  

820
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:08,880
gamestop 100 okay so this would be a good segue  to move on uh apparently we had a discussion on  

821
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,600
the last episode about running for governor and  uh i bought the domain name governor trimath.com  

822
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,880
i had governorjason.com i got governor sachs and  governor freedberg.com and i redirected them and  

823
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
you guys owned them and they're they're redirected  to your twitter handles and lo and behold we wake  

824
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:33,920
up one day and uh chamath4ca is live chamboth  everybody wants to know jump the gun we were  

825
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,640
going to have a vigorous debate and decide which  one to be yeah who's gonna run but somebody jumped  

826
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,080
in and i'm not saying other besties might not jump  in other besties could jump in they have domains  

827
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:51,440
stay tuned stay tuned no jason we do not want  to split the bestie vote i think we got all the  

828
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:57,200
best please this is this is the four musketeers  we're all behind now we do not want to split the  

829
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:05,840
bestie vote okay it's on you tell us what's  going to happen now what's going to happen

830
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,680
we are going to do an emergency  pod and talk about exactly that  

831
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,160
so if folks want to know they're going  to have to tune in midweek but uh

832
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,440
you put out a platform what's the action  been and no these the reactions been possible  

833
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,080
three guys midway i want to be i want to be  very clear midweek midweek but i'll just tell  

834
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:39,120
the quick stories three uh young people um these  three amazing guys just they built it and i just  

835
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,280
retweeted it um i can say that tens of thousands  of people have signed up for updates i know that  

836
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:51,280
much um all these three guys though here's the can  i just if i can tell a shout out to these guys um  

837
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:59,680
uh rahul samir and aman all these three guys um  they don't live in california um two did but had  

838
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:06,880
to leave one uh wants to move but can't because  he can't afford it and it's just such a microcosm  

839
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,840
of like how beautiful california as a place is  and just what people think about when they think  

840
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,520
about the state is just so it's so lovely so for  another time but um anyway shout out to those guys  

841
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:24,720
for building the website thank you so essentially  the entire market has now been driven by a group  

842
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:32,080
of all-in of the all-in army built a website you  retweeted it and that's what this is all about  

843
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:38,240
so there has been no paperwork filed there is  no action committee however it has traction  

844
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,840
so it makes one hand and you know i mean  there may be a shadow cabinet meeting maybe

845
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:52,560
what is the chances well i think chamoth by  publishing that website just went down the  

846
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:02,160
escalator escalator he's gone down the escalator  and who knows what could happen now i'll tell you  

847
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:07,680
this i went on uh i'll i'll do a plug i went on  bloomberg amazing this week amazing hit great  

848
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:13,200
amazing it's on youtube we can put the link to  the show notes yeah put the link in the show notes  

849
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:18,320
nick people need to watch that i went through all  the the the ways in which california is hurting  

850
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,200
newsom hasn't done a very good job and i made  my case for chamath so that's a prelude to what  

851
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,720
we'll talk about on the next pod but the the  the amazing thing is the outpouring i mean  

852
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:33,360
the number of people who texted me  emailed me and chamath and all of us  

853
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,120
like there's a groundswell happening now 100  so you know i would say all the fans of the pod  

854
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,800
who are now behind this you guys are making  it real uh free it's pretty crazy manifest  

855
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,520
destiny here what's going on is this another  wisdom of the crowds or a mob or a movement  

856
01:18:52,720 --> 01:19:00,400
who am i to say are you are you in as chief  science officer will you be our dr fauci you know  

857
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,440
here i i think we should have a good debate on  our next pod and hear the platform and discuss the  

858
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:13,760
platform and um you know uh make sure that we all  feel like this is uh uh this is where we should be  

859
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:20,160
um and i think this is gonna take a little bit of  time uh to uh to build um and i think you know the  

860
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:24,480
more we kind of build towards it the more likely  we are to have that ground swell that we're going  

861
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,520
to need well let's give the oil in let's give  the old i will tell you it seems pretty likely  

862
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:36,080
that this uh recall effort is going to get the  signatures it needs so we can kind of put that  

863
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,360
in the sand that it's very likely we're  going to end up seeing a recall election  

864
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:45,120
okay so if people want to participate in recall  gavin newsom what do they do because that is  

865
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:52,720
the first step yes towards governorship you  gotta go you gotta go to rescuecalifornia.org  

866
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:59,920
rescuecalifornia.org go to that website sign  the petition that is the first step we are very  

867
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,360
we only need a few hundred thousand more  signatures we have 1.2 million we need one  

868
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:09,840
point five million go there sign up and then  go to chamas website which is chamath4ca.com  

869
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,680
jason i'll make one more point and i think um and  i made this the other day on that clubhouse that  

870
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:20,720
sacks and i did i think we i made it before  you joined if you think about the difference  

871
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:27,840
between a leader and a manager um a manager is  someone who typically delegates uh responsibility  

872
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:34,800
and authority a leader is effective at  synthesizing uh multiple people's points of view  

873
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,440
and creates an opportunity defines a vision  defines an objective that is the synthesis  

874
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:46,240
of all the people that that report to him and um  and for which for whom he is responsible or she  

875
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:51,280
and i think what we've seen in california in  particular and really across leadership positions  

876
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:56,720
or governing positions across the country  during this pandemic is a failure of leadership  

877
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:03,440
because when times are predictable if a then  b it is easy to manage and it is easy to look  

878
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,840
successful i delegate down to the person who  knows best and they are responsible for the  

879
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,120
outcome and they do it well great all i'm doing  is pointing to the right person to run something  

880
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:20,080
the pandemic is difficult and it is unpredictable  it requires a synthesis of economic information  

881
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,760
social information and health information and  more often than not a person who typically acts  

882
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,840
like a manager points to the person they think  should be in charge under the circumstance to  

883
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,800
make a decision and that person is not equipped to  synthesize the economic and social ramifications  

884
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:40,000
of the decision so what we have seen during the  pandemic is most often people in a governing  

885
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,720
position have pointed to the health officer or  the medical person and said you make the decision  

886
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:49,520
and that person does not necessarily account  for the social and economic ramifications of the  

887
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,320
decision they're making a health person knows how  to save lives the best way to save lives is shut  

888
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:01,280
everything down and so the the test of leadership  during this pandemic has been a test of synthesis  

889
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:07,120
and recommending an action that's associated  with the understanding of the social economic and  

890
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:13,520
health implications of what's going on and that's  really where so many governing um bodies and  

891
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:19,200
individuals have fallen apart during this pandemic  is an inability to do that effectively and i think  

892
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:24,000
that is what is needed going forward it is a  it is a moment of test it is a it is a moment  

893
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,080
of truth about the difference between a manager  and a leader and we're seeing across the nation  

894
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:35,920
who is what and i think it is highlighting why  some folks may not be best suited to do this the  

895
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,040
second thing i'll say and i know i'm on a little  bit of a diatribe but the second thing i'll say  

896
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,880
is career we've been waiting for your diatribe  by the way we took 19 episodes go career career  

897
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,680
politicians i think simply should not exist  if you go back to the origins of this country  

898
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,600
right having your place in government and we  talked about this over email having your place in  

899
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,160
government was meant to be something that everyone  was supposed to take their turn doing and the  

900
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,520
people that were sitting in political seats it was  supposed to be the merchant and the local farmer  

901
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,920
and the banker and we were all supposed to take  our turn representing our communities representing  

902
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,160
our people in government and what we've seen  is people who have made a career out of being  

903
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:18,000
a politician and the result of that is that their  job depends on them getting re-elected in order to  

904
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,400
remain in their career they have to get re-elected  and they ultimately end up making trade-offs that  

905
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,400
don't necessarily represent the best long-term  interest of their community and this is broadly  

906
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,040
true across nations across centuries but it's  particularly acute in the united states where  

907
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:36,080
we've seen such wealth creation over the last  250 years and what's happened is when you have  

908
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,120
career politicians sitting in these seats for so  long in an environment of severe wealth creation  

909
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:46,000
you end up having governments that are ineffective  and creating systems that fail us and here we are  

910
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,040
and what we need is to have someone go in that's  not dependent on the traditional folks that get  

911
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:56,240
people elected and fund elections and result in  re-elections we need someone that can go in as an  

912
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:01,920
outsider and make a change and so my advocacy  for what's needed in california and i think  

913
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,600
nationally and that's a longer conversation is to  find those types of folks to come in and lead and  

914
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,080
be politicians that can take a leadership role  synthesize information and not be worried about  

915
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:18,080
the re-election cycle and not have anything to  lose related to a career in politics so i'm done  

916
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:26,400
on that note i want to say i love all of you  and um let's do our emergency pod on tuesday  

917
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:32,800
um do you guys want to play poker tonight i  i'm still in tahoe i was playing that original

920
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:53,120
one note if you do fill out if you take if you go  to rescue california.org is that the name yes yes  

921
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:58,240
if you go there you print out the petition and you  hold it up and take a selfie with your signature  

922
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:03,360
on it and you add the besties we will like it  possibly retweet it and possibly follow you  

923
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:08,000
so go ahead and take a picture of your printout  with your name on it and that proves that you're  

924
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,960
part of the all-in army and we will like it we  might follow you and we might even retweet you  

925
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,720
you could give your besties love you and we'll  see you all next time on the all in pocket  

926

these are really big numbers is spread the  opportunity that that technology represents  

929
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:08,080
we're probably gonna have  four kardashians on there you
